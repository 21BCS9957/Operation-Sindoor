### Running the Application

You will need two separate terminals to run both the backend and frontend servers.

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```sh
    # In the sindoor-backend directory
    cargo run
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```sh
    # In the sindoor directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).
